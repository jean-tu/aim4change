# Aim4Change

##About
This idea and application was built for Target Women In Technology Symposium Hackathon by: 
* [Mary Grace Blair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-grace-blair-085232108)
* [Sophie Manum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophiemanum)
* [Stephanie Tam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamstephaniek)

We had decided to name our team 4th Harmony becuase we were team #4 and 5th Harmony was playing in the background when we were trying to come up with a team name

##The Application 
The idea was to encourage those in the community to volunteer! A user would sign up for an account and register with their local target to be able to earn points for their local target. The points are awarded based on the number of hours the user volunteered. The top 3 local targets with the most points by the end of the quarter would receive a prize and be able to donate the sum of the prize to desired charities. 

This is just a rough build of the product because we had a tight time constraint. In the future, we would have liked to be able to add some API's to help with: 
* Log-in: 
  * Google
  * Facebook 
  * Twitter 
  * Slack 
* Location and time to check on the integrity of the volunteers 
  * This would just be a location based API and time tracking API that would allow the user to be able to check-in once they have arrived at the volunteering location and check0out once they have finished

We hope you enjoy our idea, if you have any futher questions, feel free to contact us individually through LinkedIn and you can find each individual's LinkedIn by clicking on their name.
